# Data Cleaning in Pandas Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a set of scripts for data cleaning tasks using the Pandas library in Python. The primary script, located in the `dataCleaningInPandas` directory, is designed to clean and preprocess data stored in the `source` directory so that the final clean dataset will be save in `destination` directory

## Project Structure


- **`dataCleaningInPandas/`**: Directory containing the main data cleaning/ exploring script with.
- **`source/`**: Directory containing the source data files.
- **`destination/`**: Directory containing the result data files


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (install using `pip install pandas`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:ThinhPhamWannabeCoder/DataCleaning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dataCleaningInPandas
    ```

### Usage

1. Ensure that the source data files are placed in the `source/` directory.

2. Change the directory in pd.read* adn pd.to* because what I used are absolute path

3. Run the data cleaning script:

    Do step by step in JupyterNotebook file
    
4. Make your tweak with these sample script

5. The cleaned data will be saved in `destination/` directory
